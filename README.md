# snake-game
Snake game — it was the first game many of us played on mobile phones during childhood, especially on keypad mobiles. I’ve recreated the same game using Python's Turtle library. Deploy it and run it on your computer!
You can play using the Up, Left, Right, and Down arrow keys. However, you cannot move directly from Up to Down or from Left to Right
